Hover 0.6.13
============

Please deactivate and activate your plugin to upgrade the hover tables.

Hover 0.6.9
===========

Conditional Replacement:

	Starting with 0.6.9 conditional replacment handling has changed. Before
	0.6.9 you needed to _enclose_ the hover with colons, e.g.:

		:foo:

	As of 0.6.9 you need only to _prefix_ your hover with a colon (both when
	defining it in the admin part of your wordpress installation and when
	using it in a post), e.g:

		:foo

	You can check if you have hovers with trailing colons by running the
	provided checks located under Admin/Plugins/Hover/Check and refer to the
	"Upgrade" part of the results.
